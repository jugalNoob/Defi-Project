Q what is history Amm;

Ans::for on-Chain tarding we require Amm

..Vitalik buterin proposed in 2026 the Impplementation on-chain Amm
https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/05/30/amm_history.html#the-

..Buterin's idea was first applied To AMMs  in 2017 in the bancor Protocal
which allowed trades betwween the newtworks token (BNT) the protocol Token and
othere ERC-20 tokens through specific smart tokens

..Martin  koppelmann cam up with the constant probuct formula

.. In Novermber 2018 uniswap v1 was lunched with the implemnetation of the constant product 
formula and the Liquidity pool, and allowing trading between Eth and any other  ERC-20
token

..in January 2020 curve finance Launched a new AMM that was designed Exclusively
to trading between Stablecoins with low price impact and high Efficiency


..in Several moths laer in May 2021 uniswap v3 appeared and started offering an entirely Concept
to liquidity provide concenttrated Liquidity



Q what is constant product?
ANS::Types of AMMs is algo how operate your code

constant Product:--> Uniswap Amms algo

Constant Sum --> Balancer

Curve-base AMMs --> Curve Finance

Hybrid AMMs --> sushiwap

....constant Product -->this one of the earliest and most popular AMM models

..constant Product --> it based on the conncept of maintaining of maintaining  a constant product of the two assets in liquidity pool


Number of X token=100

Number of Y toekn =200

ASSUMING Liquidity pool Fee=0

x*y=20000 [here 20000 is the constant]


suppose a trader  wants to Buy 60 x tokens
in order to buy 60 X token trader needs to deposit Y tokens
AFETR  withdrawing 60 X Token in The Liquidity Pool we will have 40 x tokens


40*y=20000
y=2000/40
y=500


Number of Y Tokens Deposited By Trader=500-200=300
After deposit Number of Y tokens =3000+200 =500
x*y=40*50=20000


Q what is Liquidity Pool?
ANS::

Liquidity --> CryptoCurrency --> Moneys

Liquidity Pool --> It IS A Pool of Token (Usually two different Types) Locked
is a smart Contract these Pool facilitate the Trading of Tokens withOut thee need for 
intermediary

Generally Liquidity Pools involves two Tokens often a popular CryptoCurrency Like Ethereim(ETH)
and An thor token (e.q Stablecoins Like DAI or another CryptoCurrency Like Links
)
